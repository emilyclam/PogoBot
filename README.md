## Backstory

### Why PogoBot?
I enjoy playing Pokemon Go in my spare time, and it's especially fun playing with friends. Although there are many online resources
that give Pokemon Go info about updates, I wanted to find a way to streamline and simplify the info-gathering process. This discord bot was made
to fulfill this purpose. 

## How PogoBot was Made
The discord.py API was used to create the pogobot.
BeautifulSoup was used to scrape information off of the leekduck.com website.
JSON was used in tangent with Pogo API to get information about raid bosses and type effectiveness.
